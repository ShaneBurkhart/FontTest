                <h1 id="post-title">Quick and Easy Guide to Starting a Business Blog For Your Business</h1>                        
                <p class="post-date">July 3, 2015 by ShaneBurkhart </p> 

                <p>I'm sure you've heard all the rage about content marketing and blogging for your business.  You may think blogging isn't for your business, or wonder how blogging is supposed to help your business.  When you blog, you're giving away information for free, and visitors aren't visiting your purchase page; how can it possibly be helping your business?</p>
                <p>You are right, customers most likely won't be visiting your purchase pages, but blogging isn't for immediate gain.  Blogging is a long term, sustainable way to keep visitors coming back to your site, and at some point, purchasing.  You may think a blog won't help your business, when in fact, it could help grow your business tremendously.</p>
                <p>Give me a few minutes to explain to you the benefits of blogging for business.  By the end of this article, you will understand why you should start a business blog immediately.</p>

                <h2>9 Reasons Your Business Should Start Blogging Immediately</h2>

                <h3><strong>1. Search engine optimization (SEO)<strong></h3>
                <p>If blogging is done correctly, you should have a lot of pages with valuable content for your target audience.  When search engines scrape your site, they will see these pages, and reward you by putting them in the top of search results.  Now, when people search for a topic you have written about, your blog will be in the results, and they will be more likely to visit your site.  </p>
                <p>Along with blog posts showing up in search results, your entire site will also improve in ranking.  Search engines rank pages based on individual page content and domain content.  What this means is when search engines begins to trust your domain, they will bump every page on your site in the search results as well.  By building search engine trust with blog posts, you are improving search rankings of other pages on your site such as your home page, purchase pages, etc.</p>
                <p>Organic traffic from search engines is one of the largest and most reliable sources of traffic for websites.  By having a business blog, you will improve in search rankings, and ensure a steady stream of new visitors visit your site.</p>

                <h3>2. More visitors to your site</h3>
                <p>With your site being higher in search results, your site will get significantly more visitors.  The best part is, if you are writing content targeted to the correct audience, these visitors should be in your target market.  Your business blog will increase your reach and bring potential customers to your site.</p>
                <p>You may be wondering how visitors to your blog are going to help your business; they aren't visiting your purchase pages, after all.  Even if visitors don't visit your purchase pages, they can very simply be turned into leads.</p>

                <h3>3. Lead generation</h3>
                <p>When you have visitors on your blog, you can turn them into leads by having them give you a piece of information — name, email, occupation, etc. — for something valuable.  </p>
                <p>Generally, visitors will give you basic information in exchange for a weekly newsletter, ebook, or some other kind of valuable content.  Remember though, by giving their email, visitors are expecting consistent value, not to be sold to.  Your goal should be to continue educating your audience, help them identify problems they may have, and give them the perception you are an authority in the field.  When it comes time to buy, they will buy from you.</p>

                <h3>4. Your audience will see you as an expert</h3>
                <p>When you are educating and identifying your audience's problems, they start to see you as an expert in your field.  </p>
                <p>Your visitors don't have your knowledge, and what may be obvious to you, may not be obvious at all to them.  This is your opportunity to share your knowledge and expertise.  By doing so, your audience will see you as an authority on the subject, and when they need an expert, they know who to call.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Stay top of mind with your audience</h3>
                <p>Selling isn't a one off process, it is long drawn out.  Not everyone is ready to buy right when the discover your business, but don't you want to be top of mind when they are ready?</p>
                <p>When you have content visitors want to read, they will continually come back for more.  This keeps you top of mind in the visitor's mind.  Now when the visitor is ready to make a buying decision, they will think of you first.</p>

                <h3>6. Promotes sharing</h3>
                <p>Everyone loves helpful content, and people love to be the one to have discovered it.  When a piece of content is truly valuable, a visitor will share it with a friend.  These shares only increase your reach and the number of visitors to your site.  As we talked about earlier, more visitors means more leads, which means more sales.</p>

                <h3>7. Make your business personable</h3>
                <p>In general, most companies are seen as dull places.  Blogging can give your company personality by giving it a voice.  Your company voice is something your visitors will begin to trust, and will make them more likely to buy from you.  </p>
                <p>Your blog is your first line of communication with your visitors. By making your business more personable, visitors will be more likely to trust you at first impression.  When visitors trust you, they will be much more likely to return to your site, buy from you, and refer you to their friends.</p>

                <h3>8. Start conversations with customers</h3>
                <p>When you put content on your blog, you will ultimately start conversations with your customers.  This could be thanking you for helping them, critiquing something you said, or just saying hi.  </p>
                <p>Occasionally, customers will ask questions or want you to elaborate on something. These comments can be potential blog content, or even help mold your business to better fit their needs.  </p>
                <p>Direct contact with your customers is very important to continue delivering what your customers want in both your blog and your business.</p>

                <h3>9. Cost effective</h3>
                <p>The beauty of blogging is that it is very cheap, and at the same time, very effective.  The costs are generally web hosting and your time, but your blog will quickly pay for itself.  With valuable content, each post will reach a large audience from your target market, and in turn, will grow your business tremendously.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Blogging will help grow your business, but remember it isn't an immediate gain.  Creating and maintaining a blog for your business is an investment, and it takes time to get going.  Once you begin to grow your audience however, you won't regret it.  You will see major increases in traffic to your site, which will cause your visitors trust you more, and increase your sales.</p>
                <p>It takes time, but blogging will more than pay for itself in the long run.  Get started now, and watch your business grow.</p>

                                                    <p>Setting up a business blog takes only a matter of minutes, and with the <a href="http://shaneburkhart.com/articles/2015/07/03/9-benefits-of-blogging-for-business/">benefits of blogging for business</a>, you're losing money every minute you don't have one.</p>
                                                    <p>According to Hubspot's marketing blog, business <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6260/Checklist-How-to-Start-a-Business-Blog.aspx">web sites, with a blog, receive 55% more visitors, and have 126% higher lead growth than those that do not.</a></p>
                                                    <p>It's obvious that blogging is important for your business, but how do you get started?  Where do you host a blog?  What do you write about?</p>
                                                    <p>Don't worry, it's not as hard as it sounds.  I have narrowed it down to 4 easy steps that should get you blogging in no time.</p>
                                                    <h2>4 Steps to Starting a Business Blog</h2>
                                                    <p><strong>1. Sign up for a blog provider.</strong>  There are many of these across the internet, but some of my favorites are <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, and <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>.  Any service will work; just pick one, and you will have a blog in less than 10 minutes.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>2. Point your main domain to your new blog.</strong>  Now you have a blog, but most blog providers give you a URL like youraccountname.wordpress.com.  This isn't pretty, and doesn't help the SEO of your site, so you need to point your domain at your blog.  There are many ways to do this, but the easiest is to ask your developer to do it.  If you don't have a developer, call your domain provider, and they will help you set it up.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>3. Brainstorm keywords and post ideas that your customers might be searching for online.</strong>  The easiest way to do this is to picture your ideal customer, and think about what they might like to know about, or questions they may have.  Keywords and post ideas don't have to be directly related to your business.  They just need to be relevant to what your customer is interested in.  Your goal is not to sell, but to educate and provide value to your customers.  When you do this, your customers will begin to follow you, and buy from you when they are ready.</p>
                                                    <p>Generally, when searching for topics and keywords, you want to target long tail keywords.  These are keywords that are more specific and greater than three words.  Because your blog is new, you won't be able to rank for high traffic, generic keywords.  Instead, you need to target long tail keywords that you can more easily rank for.  The overall traffic for these keywords will be significantly less than general keywords, but you won't rank for general keywords.  Instead, you can rank front page for a long tail keyword search, and get a majority of the traffic.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>4. Start writing.</strong>  Now that you have some keywords picked out, you should be putting out two to three articles a week.  The more frequently you write, the more quickly you will see results from your blog.  </p>
                                                    <p>Blog posts should only be as long as necessary to say what you want to say.  I prefer my articles to be 1000-2000 words, but there is nothing wrong with a 200 word article that provides value to your audience.  </p>
                                                    <p>Remember to be patient, however.  On average, <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/does-blogging-work">it takes 6 months before you see older posts bringing in significant amounts of traffic</a>.  This will depend on the frequency that you publish, and your ability to create valuable content targeted at long tail keywords.  Blogging is an investment not an immediate gain, but will more than pay off in the future.  Once your blog picks up, it will continue to draw traffic for a very long time.</p>
                                                    <h2>Alternatively</h2>
                                                    <p>If you don't feel like messing with steps one and two &amp;mdash setting up your blog provider and pointing your domain to it &amp;mdash you can always hire a developer to do it for you.  This will cost you a little extra money, but you will most likely get a better result.  A developer can make the site look like your current site, and do any custom modifications you would like.</p>
                                                    <p>You can also hire someone to maintain and write content for you blog.  This is going to cost you some extra money as well, but will take a lot of the burden off of you.  In the long run, your blog will more than pay for itself, and the investment is well worth it.</p>
                                                    <h2>Bonus: How to Promote Your Content</h2>
                                                    <p>It will take a while before you will see organic search traffic coming in, but you can speed this process up a bit by promoting it yourself.  Here are a few links to help you get started:</p>
